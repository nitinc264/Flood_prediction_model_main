# 🌊 Flood Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning (XGBoost) to predict flood risk (High Risk / Low Risk) based on static environmental and hydrological data. The model achieves 98.2% accuracy (AUC = 0.98) and includes visualizations like confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importances, risk probability distributions, and geospatial heatmaps.

## 🚀 Features
- Classification of flood risk zones with high accuracy.
- Feature importance analysis to identify key environmental risk drivers.
- Visualizations to support flood risk assessment and planning.
